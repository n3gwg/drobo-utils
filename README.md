# drobo-utils

This is a copy of Peter Silva's Drobo-Utils though updated and modified.

It is worthy of notation that Peter Silva's latest version of the utilities was published
on 06 FEB 2010 and is version 0.6.2.2 thereof. The versionof Python that his last updates
support is Python 2.4, now deprecated for Python3 and by extension so to are his versions
of the Drobo-Utils also deprecated for the issue of Python2.

Now therefore, this new repository is intended to substantiate updates and changes to the
last version of Drobo-Utils in pursuance of fortifying the package by supporting Python3,
as well as being to functionally create a ".deb" file that can be installed using current
versions of Debian based Linux (Debian Buster, Kali 2020, Ubuntu 20.04, et cetera).

From this juncture on forward we will start with version 1.0.0.0, in order to provde some
differentiation from the versions published by Peter Silva.
